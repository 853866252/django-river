0.6.1 (Stable)
--------------

* **Bug** - After ``content_type`` and ``field`` are moved into ``ProceedingMeta`` model from ``Transition`` model in version ``0.6.0``, finding initial and final states was failing. This is fixed.
* **Bug** - ``0002`` migrations was trying to set default slug field of State model. There was a unique problem. It is fixed. ``0002`` can be migrated now.
* **Improvement** - The way of finding initial and final states is changed. ProceedingMeta now has parent-child tree structure to present state machine. This tree structure is used to define the way. This requires to migrate ``0003``. This migration will build the tree of your existed ProceedingMeta data.
